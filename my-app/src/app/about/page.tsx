                    Hello! I’m Mehwish Naz, a passionate web developer with a strong focus on building dynamic and engaging web applications using Next.js. 
                    With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I create responsive and user-friendly interfaces that enhance the overall user experience. 
                    My journey in web development began with JavaScript, and I've since expanded my skill set to include TypeScript, allowing me to write cleaner and more maintainable code. 
                    I have a deep understanding of modern web technologies and best practices, including server-side rendering, static site generation, and API integration, which I leverage to optimize performance and SEO. 
                    Additionally, I am proficient in Python, which allows me to work seamlessly on the backend, integrating databases and creating robust applications.
               <br /> <br />
               I enjoy collaborating with designers and stakeholders to bring ideas to life, ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs and business goals. 
                    My two years of experience in web development have equipped me with the ability to tackle complex challenges, continuously learn new tools, and stay updated with the latest trends in the industry. <br /> <br />
                    Whether I’m crafting elegant layouts, implementing intricate functionalities, or optimizing existing applications, I thrive on the excitement of solving problems and delivering high-quality solutions. 
                    Let’s connect and create something amazing together! <br /><br />
